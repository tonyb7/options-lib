## Pricing
### Binomial Options Pricing
### Black-Scholes Model
The Black-Scholes equation is: 

$rS\frac{\partial C}{\partial S}+\frac{1}{2}\sigma^2S^2\frac{\partial^2 C}{\partial S^2}+\frac{\partial C}{\partial t} = rC$

where $C$ is the value of a call, $S$ is the stock price, $t$ is time, $\sigma$ is volatility, and $r$ is the interest rate.
